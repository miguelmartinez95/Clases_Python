Classes create to build machine learning models:
- ML_v2: general class to preprocess data
- MLP_model_v2: class to build and train and predict with MLP models
- SVM_model_v2: class to build and train and predict with SVM models
- MyProblem_mlp: problem to optimise MLP architecture
- MyProblem_svm: problem to optimise SVM architecture
- MyRepair_mlp: function to repair the searching for optimisation
- MyRepair_svr: function to repair the searching for optimisation
