# Clases_Python
In this repository is where all the python classes created are stored and modified.

The classes are:
 1. reading_files (Reading_files). Read different type of files and collect data from platforms such as cronograph
 2. convert_utc (Solving_utc): Code to solve different problems with time schedules
 3. exploratory_analysis (Exploratory_analysis): Different function to fastly analise the data (Plots, missing data, etc)
 4. errors (Eval_metrics): Calculation of the more common metrics (cv_rmse, nmbe, r2)
 5. ML: Class to create machine learning models and carry out the needed data pre-processing 
      MLP: MultiLayer Perceptron neural network
      XGB: eXtreme Gradient Boosting
      SVR: Support Vector Regression
 4. DL: Class to create deep learning models and carry out the needed data pre-processing
      LSTM_model: Long Short-Therm Memory models
